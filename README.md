The dashboard provides a comprehensive review of e-commerce sales performance, presenting several KPIs such as sales, quantity, profit, number of orders, and profit margin. The Year-On-Year (YOY) growth calculation for each KPI helps identify trends and set future growth goals.

YOY growth is commonly used in business to assess performance over time, identify trends and patterns, and set future growth goals. For example, a company may use year-on-year growth to compare their sales performance from one year to the next, identify areas of improvement or success, and evaluate the effectiveness of marketing campaigns, product launches, or other business initiatives.

The first chart is a combo chart. It compares sales and profit for each month, helping to identify the correlation between these two variables. It is clear that there is a positive relationship between sales and profit. The highest sales and profit occur in December, likely due to holiday shopping.

The category-wise profit waterfall chart displays the profit obtained by three categories, providing valuable insights into the profitability of each category. It is clear that technology has the highest profitability, while furniture has the lowest.

The horizontal bar chart (Top 5 subcategories) shows the top 5 categories by sales, providing a quick and easy way to identify the most popular products and the categories driving the most revenue. Phones have the highest sales, followed by chairs, storage, tables, and binders. This information can help inform marketing and sales strategies and identify opportunities for growth in specific categories.

The donut chart (Category-wise Profit) shows the percentage of profit obtained by each category, helping to understand the relative profitability of each category. It is clear that technology has the highest percentage of profit, followed by furniture and office supplies. This information can help identify areas of opportunity for profit growth and prioritize efforts to maximize profit in the most profitable categories.

The heatmap shows which state has the highest sales, helping to identify where sales are performing the best. California has the highest sales.

Slicers allow users to see changes in the dashboard dynamically.

Overall, the dashboard is a powerful tool for monitoring and analyzing e-commerce sales data. The dynamic filters make it easy to drill down into specific areas and identify trends over time. The combination of different types of visualizations, including charts, graphs, and heatmaps, provides a clear and comprehensive view of sales performance. This information can be used to inform business decisions, set goals for growth, and identify opportunities for improving profitability.
